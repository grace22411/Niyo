# Eth Denver Niyo
Niyo is a mobile first tool that economically empowers hair, beauty and fashion creators, pros, enthusiasts and influencers for their creativity. Creators earn by turning their creations and content into F-NFT.  The creator's supporters will be able to convert F-NFTs into real products and services that users can purchase using their tokens and therefore get real utility. Aggregating payments with community-driven escrow service.

## Problem
The creator economy is a booming one, yet creators and their supporters are still not rewarded for their work on the current social platforms that exist. The power of web 3 is that it decentralises power, yet creators are still not aware of how this could economically empower them. With Niyo, creators will become adopters of crypto and also be rewarded for their art from picture/video to service or product.

## Vision
We believe that  creators and their supporters should be economically empowered for their interaction and also for the creator's content. We want to see a world where NFTs are not just images but supporters can redeem their 'investment' for real products and services that the creator  has created. 
Once a creator uploads a creation, they  get onboarded onto the Niyo Dao and recieve tokens as rewards, those who like the creators become part of the creator;s community. We have a big vision of  mass adoption of crypto in the non-crypto native Hair, Beauty and Fashion Ecosystem.

## Market Analysis
 Currently, there is no mobile friendly Dapp that serves for the large creator economy to maximise their productivity and to truly be rewarded for their creation.  The size of the creator economy is around $3.8 Trillion  but yet it is not adopted in the web 3 space. Onboarding creators who are not 'traditional' artists could scale  web 3 to further unreached and underserved audiences.



### Revenue Streams

- Product Sales - Through our ecommerce platform (niyohairandbeauty.com and affiliate links from other brands products)
- Royaalties - royalty fees from  creators to list as many of their creation as possible
- Partnership fees - Partnership with NFT projects that implement NFTs on physical products
- Training from DAO- Training fees from the users who will like to get accredited as Niyo creators.


### Impact

Social Impact - Most people in the creator economy  come from underrepresented  backgrounds and still are suffering from relative poverty namely black and brown backgrounds. The work we will be doing at Niyo would act as a tool for economic empowerment with focus on addressing the  no poverty  and reducing inequalities SDGs

Impact of economic growth- The platform would be deployed purposefully in countries with a large population of black and brown people so that there would be  more economic growth in regions that have been disenfranchised.

### Further developments

We are planning to develop the technology behind our try on feature so as to enable our users can  have the best user experience when interacting with the technology.
