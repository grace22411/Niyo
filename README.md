# Eth Denver Niyo
Niyo is a mobile first tool that economically empowers hair, beauty and fashion creators, pros, enthusiasts and influencers for their creativity. Creators earn by turning their creations and content into F-NFT.  The creator's supporters will be able to convert F-NFTs into real products and services that users can purchase using their tokens and therefore get real utility. Aggregating payments with community-driven escrow service.

## Problem
The creator economy is a booming one, yet creators and their supporters are still not rewarded for their work on the current social platforms that exist. The power of web 3 is that it decentralises power, yet creators are still not aware of how this could economically empower them. With Niyo, creators will become adopters of crypto and also be rewarded for their art from picture/video to service or product.

## Vision
We believe that  creators and their supporters should be economically empowered for their interaction and also for the creator's content. We want to see a world where NFTs are not just images but supporters can redeem their 'investment' for real products and services that the creator  has created. 
Once a creator uploads a creation, they  get onboarded onto the Niyo Dao and recieve tokens as rewards, those who like the creators become part of the creator;s community. We have a big vision of  mass adoption of crypto in the non-crypto native Hair, Beauty and Fashion Ecosystem.

### Mission

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
