# Eth Denver Niyo
Niyo is a mobile first tool that economically empowers hair, beauty and fashion creators, pros, enthusiasts and influencers for their creativity. Creators earn by turning their creations and content into F-NFT.  The creator's supporters will be able to convert F-NFTs into real products and services that users can purchase using their tokens and therefore get real utility. Aggregating payments with community-driven escrow service.

## Problem
The creator economy is a booming one, yet creators and their supporters are still not rewarded for their work on the current social platforms that exist. The power of web 3 is that it decentralises power, yet creators are still not aware of how this could economically empower them. With Niyo, creators will become adopters of crypto and also be rewarded for their art from picture/video to service or product.

## Vision
We believe that  creators and their supporters should be economically empowered for their interaction and also for the creator's content. We want to see a world where NFTs are not just images but supporters can redeem their 'investment' for real products and services that the creator  has created. 
Once a creator uploads a creation, they  get onboarded onto the Niyo Dao and recieve tokens as rewards, those who like the creators become part of the creator;s community. We have a big vision of  mass adoption of crypto in the non-crypto native Hair, Beauty and Fashion Ecosystem.
